#Installation

VotaInteligente depends on 3 parts candideit.org, popit and write-it. You might choose to use all of them or just part. In the following document it is described how to install.

## Assumptions

This guide was made using an ubuntu 13.10 just installed.

## Requirements

Before the installation process is started a number of requirements is needed

- [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
- [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- The requirements that [sorl-thumbnail has](http://sorl-thumbnail.readthedocs.org/en/latest/requirements.html)
- The requirements that [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.1.x/installation.html#linux-installation) has for your distribution.
- PgMagick (You can install PgMagick in ubuntu by running `sudo apt-get install python-pgmagick`)

## Installation process

* Clone votainteligente somewhere in your system.

`git clone https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/votainteligente-portal-electoral.git`

Enter the installation directory

`cd votainteligente-portal-electoral`

* Create a virtual environment

`mkvirtualenv votainteligente`

Here you can optionally give the command the full path to the installation directory by adding -a <full_path>.
* If you didn't use the -a option you'll have to cd into the directory.

`cd votainteligente-portal-electoral`

* Install the requirements that votainteligente needs in the current virtualenvironment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

It might take some time to get all installed

* Create the database and tables.

`python manage.py migrate`


* Running VotaInteligente

`python manage.py runserver`

And hit http://localhost:8000/.

## Theming

#### Previously created themes

* [votainteligente-venezuela-theme](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/votainteligente-venezuela-theme) is the theme for [eligetucandidato.org](http://eligetucandidato.org/)

### Creating your own custom theme

If you want to create a new theme you have to create a directory containing two different subdirectories templates and static, and copy the templates that you want to replace.

And in your project in your local_settings.py file you have to add the following

```
 STATICFILES_DIRS = (
     '/full/path/to/your/theme/static/',
 )
 TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
     '/full/path/to/your/theme/templates/',
 )
```
## Testing

You can run tests by doing:
```
$ ./test.sh
```

And there is a shortcut for testing without migrations:

```
$ ./t.sh
```
